The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP continued to expand in 2025, at a rate slightly below its 2024 pace. Labor market conditions showed signs of stabilizing following a period of gradual cooling. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.
The unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in December, unchanged from its level in September. The average monthly change in total payrolls turned negative in the fourth quarter, reflecting a large drop in government employment in October as workers rolled off payrolls after the end of the deferred resignation program; average payroll gains in November and December were similar to the average gains seen over the third quarter. Average hourly earnings rose 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in December, slightly below their year-earlier pace.
Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for PCE—was 2.8 percent in November, a little higher than its year-earlier pace of 2.6 percent. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 2.8 percent in November, compared with 3.0 percent a year earlier. Core services price inflation had declined relative to a year earlier, led by a deceleration in housing services prices. However, core goods price inflation had picked up over that period, a development that the staff largely attributed to the effects of higher tariffs. In December, the 12-month change in the CPI was 2.7 percent and core CPI inflation was 2.6 percent; both were below their year-earlier rates. Based on the CPI, the staff estimated that total PCE price inflation was 2.9 percent in December and core PCE price inflation was 3.0 percent. The staff also noted that data collection issues related to the government shutdown had likely pushed down the levels of the CPI and the PCE price index in November and December.
Real GDP posted a solid gain in the third quarter. Available indicators suggested that real GDP growth had slowed in the fourth quarter, with the government shutdown estimated to have reduced fourth-quarter real GDP growth about 1 percentage point. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal of underlying economic momentum than does GDP—rose at the same average pace as real GDP over the first three quarters of 2025; available indicators suggested that real PDFP growth also slowed in the fourth quarter but less markedly than real GDP growth. Nominal goods exports rose further in October, while nominal goods imports declined sharply after falling in the third quarter. Accordingly, the goods trade deficit continued to narrow following a substantial widening at the start of 2025 that resulted from a front-loading of imports ahead of anticipated tariff hikes.
Recent indicators suggested that foreign economic activity expanded at a below-trend pace in the second half of last year. U.S. tariffs continued to weigh on foreign manufacturing activity, notably for Canada and Mexico in autos, aluminum, steel, and related industries. By contrast, in some emerging Asian economies, exports of high-tech products surged amid robust demand from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In China, activity was boosted by strong exports to markets other than the U.S.
Headline inflation continued to run near central bank targets in many foreign economies, although upward pressures on food and services prices remained in some jurisdictions. A few foreign central banks cut their policy rates, including the Bank of England and the Bank of Mexico, but most others left them unchanged. The Bank of Japan was a notable exception, raising its key policy rate toward its assessment of the neutral range.
